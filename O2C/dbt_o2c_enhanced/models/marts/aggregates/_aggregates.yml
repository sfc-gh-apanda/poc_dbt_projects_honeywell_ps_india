      **Customer O2C Aggregates**
      
      **Data Load Pattern:** TRUNCATE & LOAD (materialized='table')
      
      Pre-aggregated O2C metrics by customer for fast dashboard queries.
      Full table replacement on every run.
      
      **Audit Columns (7 uniform):**
      - dbt_run_id: dbt invocation ID
      - dbt_batch_id: Unique per model per run
      - dbt_loaded_at: Load timestamp
      - dbt_created_at: = dbt_updated_at (full refresh)
      - dbt_updated_at: Same as created (full table rebuild)
      - dbt_source_model: Model name
      - dbt_environment: Target environment (dev/prod)
