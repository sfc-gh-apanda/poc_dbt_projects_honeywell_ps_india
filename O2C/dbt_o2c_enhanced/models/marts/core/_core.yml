      **Data Load Pattern:** MERGE / UPSERT (incremental_strategy='merge')
      
      Joins orders, invoices, and payments into a complete O2C view.
      - New records: INSERT with current dbt_created_at
      - Existing records: UPDATE with original dbt_created_at preserved
      
      **Audit Columns (7 uniform):**
      - dbt_run_id: dbt invocation ID (updated on every run)
      - dbt_batch_id: Unique per model per run (updated on every run)
      - dbt_loaded_at: Load timestamp (updated on every run)
      - dbt_created_at: PRESERVED for existing rows, set for new rows
      - dbt_updated_at: Always current timestamp
      - dbt_source_model: Model name
      - dbt_environment: Target environment (dev/prod)
      - dbt_row_hash: Change detection hash (bonus column)
